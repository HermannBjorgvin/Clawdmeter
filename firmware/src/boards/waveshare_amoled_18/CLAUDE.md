# AMOLED-1.8 (S3) — `waveshare_amoled_18`

Hardware notes for this board. Shared firmware rules are in `firmware/CLAUDE.md`.

Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8 (368×448 portrait, XCA9554 IO expander). Build env: `waveshare_amoled_18`. **Two panel revisions are auto-detected at boot** (`board_rev()` in `board_init.cpp`, enum in `board_rev.h`): original = SH8601 display + FT3168 touch (0x38); later = CO5300 display + CST816 touch (0x15). One binary drives both.

## Hardware (critical pins)

**Two hardware revisions ship under this name; the firmware probes I2C at boot and picks drivers automatically (`board_rev()`):**
- Display: **SH8601** (original) or **CO5300** (later rev) AMOLED via QSPI (CS=12, **SCLK=11** ← different!, SDIO0..3=4..7, RST routed via XCA9554 EXIO1). Both are `Arduino_OLED` subclasses held behind one base pointer in `display.cpp`. The CO5300's 368-wide active area starts at GRAM column 16, so it gets `CO5300_COL_OFFSET 16` to center; SH8601 needs none.
- Touch: **FT3168** @ 0x38 (original) or **CST816** @ 0x15 (later rev), via I2C (SDA=15, SCL=14, INT=21). Both expose the same FocalTech-style data layout at regs 0x02..0x06, so one inline reader in `touch.cpp` serves both — only the address differs. Avoids vendoring the GPLv3 `Arduino_DriveBus` library. Revision is detected by which touch address ACKs (CST816 present ⇒ CO5300 panel).
- PMU: AXP2101 @ 0x34 (same chip as 2.16 — `XPowersLib` reused; battery is an optional kit add-on but PMU + charging circuitry are populated)
- IMU: QMI8658 @ 0x6B (same chip — initialized for I2C bus health, rotation logic disabled)
- IO expander: **XCA9554 / PCA9554** @ I2C 0x20. Gates LCD_RST, TP_RST, audio amp enable, and reads the PWR button. **`io_expander_init()` MUST run before `gfx->begin()` or `touch_hal_init()`** — otherwise display/touch stay in reset and silently fail. PWR button is on EXIO4, active HIGH (verified empirically with the deleted `iox` serial debug command).
- Orientation: **fixed at 0°**. IMU auto-rotation is off (`BOARD_HAS_ROTATION 0`).
- Buttons: GPIO 0 (BOOT → Space/voice-mode), XCA9554 EXIO4 (PWR → brightness; hold → pair). **No third button** (GPIO 18 button doesn't exist on this board).
- **XCA9554 EXIO2 must stay HIGH.** Pulling it low takes the FT3168 off the I2C bus (IDF reports `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`, which looks like an I2S/driver wedge). Amp enable is GPIO 46 only.
