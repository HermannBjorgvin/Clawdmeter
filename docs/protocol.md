# BLE protocol

Usage readings and hook events reach the app independently. The app selects
an account, builds a JSON payload, and writes it to the device over Bluetooth
LE. The firmware updates the meters and passes activity to Clawd's director.
Keyboard button reports use the separate HID service.

## Service and characteristics

The device advertises a custom GATT service next to the standard HID keyboard service:

|                                | UUID                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data service**               | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000001` |
| RX characteristic (write)      | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000002` |
| TX characteristic (notify)     | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000003` |
| REQ characteristic (notify)    | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000004` |
| **HID service**                | `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

The host writes one complete JSON object to RX per write. The app limits
payloads to 500 bytes; the firmware has a 512-byte receive buffer, including
the terminating null byte. The device notifies `0x01` on REQ when it has no
data yet, asking for a poll.
It sends `{"dismiss":true}` on TX when a tap or the device's 2-minute timeout
ends an alert, so the app clears its corresponding alert too. The app expires
an alert nothing cleared after the same 2 minutes (a test alert after 30
seconds) and sends `x` if the device still shows it.

```json
{"s":45,"sr":120,"w":28,"wr":7200,"st":"allowed","acct":"pro","ok":true,"a":2,"e":"p","es":14,"n":1}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `s`, `w` | Session and weekly % used. |
| `sr`, `wr` | Minutes until each resets; `-1` = window not started / unknown. |
| `st` | `allowed`, `limited` or `overage` (stored, not shown). |
| `acct` | `pro`, or `ent` for a spend-capped account: `s` is then the spend %, and `tp` (% of the billing period elapsed), `pd` (period length in days) and `rd` (reset date, e.g. `"Nov 1"`) fill the second card. |
| `t`, `tf` | Local wall-clock epoch and 12/24-hour format, when the clock is on. |
| `c` | `1` = the reset chime may sound. |
| `ok` | `false` alone = no usable account data; do not treat this as a zero reading. |
| `b`, `m`, `x` | Attention: alert chime, message (ASCII), end the alert. The app sends a fixed line per alert kind in `m`: `Question for you`, `Permission needed!` (also for other notification types), `Waiting for you!` (idle) or `MCP request!`; the test alert sends `Clawdmeter test alert`. The firmware shows whatever `m` it gets. |
| `a`, `e`, `es`, `n` | Fast clock: activity 0–3, latest hook event (`p` prompt, `s` stop, `b` back after a gap) and its sequence number, active sessions. |
| `rp` | `1` = the usage numbers are a replay, not a fresh poll (heartbeats, and writes between polls for an event, `a`/`n` change, alert or setting); the rate math and reset detection skip them. Fast-clock fields in the same write still count: a new `es` fires. |
| `lv` | How lively Clawd is, `1` (No-nonsense) to `5` (All-nonsense); `3` is the default. Sent with every data payload and right away when the setting changes. The device stores the last value in NVS, so it applies from boot before the app connects; absent = keep the stored value. |
| `aa` | How long Clawd points and waves for an alert, in seconds: `120` (the default, the whole alert), `30`, `10`, or `0` = no animation. Only the animation: the alert's message, tap, `x`, timeout and dismiss notify are unchanged. Sent like `lv` and stored the same way (clamped to 0–120); absent = keep the stored value. |
| `pm` | Pace marker: `1` draws a line on the session and weekly bars at the elapsed share of each window (5 hours, 7 days) and colours the fill by pace (green at or behind it, amber ahead, red at 100%); `0` keeps the plain 50/80% colours. A bar with no reset time (`sr`/`wr` = -1) and spend-capped accounts keep the plain colours. Sent like `lv` and stored the same way; absent = keep the stored value. |
| `th` | Palette: 66 hex digits, eleven `rrggbb` colours run together in this order: background, cards, text, secondary text, accent, green, amber, red, bar track, Clawd, face eyes (`firmware/src/theme_palette.h`). The board repaints live and keeps it in NVS; a string of any other length or with a non-hex digit is ignored. The Clawd colour paints the screensaver face and the sprite: at draw time the official art's body orange and the shaded side of his body become that colour and the same shade of it, while his eyes, props and scenery keep their own colours (`theme_clawd_art`; the frames are never changed). The app sends a preset theme's palette or the user's own colours; the board doesn't know which. The 1-bit e-paper board draws every pixel at luminance 64 or more as ink, so a palette should keep the text and the cards on opposite sides of that line there. Absent = keep the stored palette. |
